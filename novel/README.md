# Human Soul
This [HumanSoul.py] uses a Markov chain generator. Using text from three different source books (The Monkeys Paw, Meditation, and The Way of Peace), 
the Markov chain generated sentences from each of these books and created something new. 

The "HumanSoul" novel script expects a file called "Meditation_TheMonkeysPaw_TheWayofPeace.txt" to be used in the same directory when the program runs to pull random sentences from.

The code not only uses the Markov chain generator but also uses a code provided my Professor Zach Whalen which helps convert the code print to print in pdf form.

While creating a new Novel ("What's in the EggNog?") I learned how to creating chapters and paragraphs with the help of Zach Whalen. I decided to return to this novel to apply what I had learned to see what the output would be. Originally, I wanted to show the text in paragraphs and chapters but wasn't able to figure out how. I am glad I learned how to do it because I really like how it turned out.
