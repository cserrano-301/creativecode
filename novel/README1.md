## Human Soul
This [python script](HumanSoul.py) uses a Markov chain generator. Using text from three different source books (The Monkeys Paw, Meditation, and The Way of Peace), 
the Markov chain generated sentences from each of these books and created something new. 

The "HumanSoul" novel script expects a file called "Meditation_TheMonkeysPaw_TheWayofPeace.txt" to be used in the same directory when the program runs to pull random sentences from.

The code not only uses the Markov chain generator but also uses a code provided my Zach Whalen which helps convert the code print to print in pdf form.
