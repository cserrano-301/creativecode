
all right so begin by finding a
comfortable seat some it
matters how you cross your legs
but because we're beginners let's just
find any seat that feels comfortable and
that puts you at ease
place your hands either on your knees or
in your lap whichever you prefer I like
to place one hand on top of the other
palms facing upward in my lap with the
thumbs touching aligned with my nose but
again we're beginners so just do what
feels good if you have some kind of
injury do what you need to do to find
support this might mean propping up your
back sitting in a chair supporting your
knees with the pillow or keeping your
legs straight ultimately you know what
feels best for your body and if you have
no injuries try to find a seated upright
cross-legged position that feels most
comfortable once you find a comfortable
seat you want to sit up straight but you
also don't want to forcefully elongate
that just doesn't feel natural and
you'll get tired very quickly you also
want to make sure you're not rounding
through your neck so just press your
chin back a little bit and now close
your eyes and find some calm
music
once you've found a grounding position
will aim to hold it so through the
meditation process we don't want to
fidget or move this can be the hardest
part but it gets easier with practice
now if you're new to meditation you may
find that after a few minutes your leg
might go numb fall asleep or start to
tingle ideally you want to ride this
feeling out but if you really can't and
you feel you need to move will cover the
techniques on how to go about doing this
in a mindful way in the third   of
this series for now just find a
comfortable seat and hand positioning
and hold it finally tune into the
sensation
music
it all comes down to the breath take a
moment to tune into your natural
breathing rhythm you don't need to take
longer inhales or more forceful exhales
just breathe as you normally would in
and out through your nose into your
belly now usually when we're unconscious
of the breath we breathe into the chest
which is more often how long breathes
when in a fight-or-flight response
breathing into the belly sends
relaxation signals to the mind and
mimics the breath when we are at rest
like when we're sleeping have you ever
watched a baby breathing the belly
visibly rises and falls breathing into
the belly also helps to gently massage
the internal organs and helps us become
more aware of the sensations in the
abdomen the beauty of a pasta is that it
allows for a moment-to-moment
investigation of the mind-body process
through a calm open and compassionate
awareness we learn to observe our
experience from a place of spacious
stillness which enables us to experience
clarity and insight into the nature of
who we are so now we become aware of the
breath when breathing in you feel that
your abdomen is rising and when you
exhale you feel your abdomen is dropping
now all I want you to do is  this
breathing so as you inhale you say
silently to yourself in your mind rising
rising rising and as you exhale you say
silently to yourself in your mind
falling falling falling simply
describing the rising and falling motion
of the belly as it happens
so you continue rising rising rising and
falling falling falling remember I said
that it always comes down to the breath
so if your mind has wandered for a
little bit and you become aware of it
simply bring that awareness back to the
breath continuously it rising
rising rising falling falling falling
all right so I'm going to pause essentially to find a
comfortable seat and to remember to
always return to the breathing it
as the abdomen rises and as it's all
pretty simple right another question is
what do you do with certain sensations
or emotions arise or if certain thoughts
enter into the mind while you're
meditating this is something we're going
to dive into in the 
in
loving kindness and directing
well-wishes 
always

means emptying your mind completely not
having any thoughts at all what I was
enlightened to learn is that in this
form of meditation you aren't trying to
stop the thoughts from coming in but
rather you're just observing them so
let's say you're mindful of your
breathing it as we did before
rising rising rising falling falling
falling but suddenly a sensation
you out of the mindfulness of breathing
this sensation might be hearing 
can see in your mind an image of a
tropical beach whichever of your senses
is being called on simply  it so
you might  it listening smelling
feeling or seeing by it become
aware of it you acknowledge it you
observe it for what it is without
allowing yourself to go into deeper
does we bring the focus back to the
breath rising and falling oh and now you
suddenly hear something but don't
explore it just observe it and  it
listening listening listening or you
might even call it hearing hearing
hearing it doesn't matter what you call
it so long as it makes sense to you
observe it then let it go and return to
the breath
now what happens when a thought enters
into the mind not just a sensation but a
thought maybe you're thinking about
something that happened in the past like
a mistake you made earlier in the day or
maybe your mind is wandering to the
future thinking about what you're going
your mind is wandering to an imaginary
world where you've just won the lottery
whatever it is just as we did before
we're gonna become aware of it and 
it so let's say we're focused on the
breath rising and falling and suddenly
we remember a silly thing that we did
earlier in the day that really
embarrassed us instead of delving deeper
into this feeling and feeling even more
foolish for what we did we just 
the experience instead remembering
remembering remembering continuing to
repeat this until we become mindful of
the fact that it's just a thought we
don't judge the thought we don't 
the thought as good or bad or try to
make sense of the thought we just
observe it in a detached manner after a
few seconds or moments of the
thought will pass which again allows us
to bring the attention back to the
rising and falling of the abdomen if the
thought is of something that might
happen in the future you can simply
it planning or if it's something
you're daydreaming about perhaps you can
it imagining now this meditation
allows us to empty the mind of plans and
memories it allows the thoughts to flow
away as they do so we can focus on the
rising and falling movement happening
right now because all we've really got
is the now in the moments where you're
aware of only the breath you allow the
mind to be still allowing it to rest in
those spaces in a way this is how we
empty the mind not by actively willing
it to be empty but rather by becoming
aware of the breath honoring the passing
sensations and thoughts letting them go
and then returning to the breath
