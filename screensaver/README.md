# Rotating boxes - trampoline effect 
 


This project is a "screensaver" designed for the media wall in the HCC. The main image is a logo of umw with a solid-colored square behind it. That logo moves around in the open space and changes color whenever it strikes a wall. The walls around this space are designed to match the opening on the media wall, so the effect is the logo bouncing around on that irregularly-shaped screen.

For version I'm sharing here, run it by copying the javascript [source code](forthewall.js) into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org).
