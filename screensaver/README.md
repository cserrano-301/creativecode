# Rotating boxes - trampoline effect 
 

This is a screensaver project for my Creative Coding class. The hardest part for me was coming up with an idea for this project. I decided to start playing around with the different features of p5.js to see what they did. Initially, I was drawn to the box in a box effect and liked how I could rotate the boxes within themselves to create a nice effect. I tried other designs which lead me to the pulsing effect. It reminds me of jumping on a trampoline.

I was able to utilize code from the p5.js reference guide as well as code from The Coding Train on youtube: https://youtu.be/yPWkPOfnGsw
Most of the code became trial and error with adjusting the parameters as well as adding and taking away pieces of the code to see what would happen. The end result is something I am happy with.

It can also be run the code "screensaver/Rotating boxes - trampoline effect.js" in a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org).
