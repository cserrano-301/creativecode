# Horsing Around 
 

As part of my Creative Coding class we created screensavers using the different features of p5.js. The first one I completed can be found in this same directory. I decided I liked my screensaver so much that I only wanted to change it a little. So 
I decided to incorporate an image that captured the feeling I had every time the image seemed to be jumping out at me as though it was bouncing on a trampoline.

To view this screensaver in fullscreen: https://editor.p5js.org/cserrano/full/5Yb5NOUi0


It can also run the code "screensaver/HorsingAround.js" in a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org).
