# Bot Project

As part of my Bot Project, I created two bots. My first was [@AbotofH](https://twitter.com/AbotofH). I wanted to create something that would make people think about the beautiful scenery that we all tend to take advantage of.

My second bot, [@BullyFreeB](https://twitter.com/BullyFreeB), came to fruition after creating my first bot. The kids were on their way to school and I sat down to work on my school work for other classes and the thought popped in my head to create an anti-bulling bot. So I did.  

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar.
