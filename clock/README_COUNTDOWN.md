# Countdown to Christmas

The month of December is filled with the excitement of Christmas so why not join in the fun with a little countdown.

I was able to get the meridiem to show correctly with the help of the https://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder-projects/projects/digital_clock/. I was also able to utilize a flashing effect with help from https://codepen.io/lislis/pen/GOVNKb. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to figure out how to incorporate the flashing text on just a specific section.

You can check out my clock in P5.js by following this link:https://editor.p5js.org/cserrano/full/ZTbsVsnCp you can also copy the code from the javascript file (countdown_to_christmas.js) and run it in http://editor.p5js.org.
