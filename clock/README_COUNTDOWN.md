# Countdown to Christmas

The month of December is filled with the excitement of Christmas so why not join in the fun with a little countdown.
As if a countdown to Christmas wasn't enough, I decided to add a flashing effect to the text with help from https://codepen.io/lislis/pen/GOVNKb. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to figure out how to incorporate the flashing text in just a specific text section. 

I utilized most of my code from my original clock project ("Work Hard Dream Big") with some tweaks to remove the images and replace with just one and to add the countdown feature.

You can check out my clock in P5.js by following this link:https://editor.p5js.org/cserrano/full/ZTbsVsnCp you can also copy the code from the javascript file (countdown_to_christmas.js) and run it in http://editor.p5js.org.
