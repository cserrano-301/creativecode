# Work Hard - Dream Big Clock

My clock does many things for me. Not only does it provide me with the date and time but it encourages me to dream big. As we get older, we often forget about different dreams and shift gear to reality and what is going on in our day-to-day. I really like this clock because it helps me to remember my dreams and why I work as hard as I do. I guess you could say that it gives me a bit of motivation to push through the day because I know I have something to look forward to. One of my biggest dreams is to be able to travel the world to see amazing sites, experience the history and the culture in other countries. This allows me to stay focused on some of those goals.

With the help of the https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/preload, I was able to get multiple pictures located within the code. I also referenced https://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder-projects/projects/digital_clock/ to help me get meridiem to populate correctly.

Figuring out UTC was a bit of a struggle but eventually, I got it to code correctly. It does have to be adjusted during daylight savings time and winter/summertime in Ireland.
